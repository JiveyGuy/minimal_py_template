# minimal_py_template
My personal py template for what I like to have in a project. Other templates have many useful features but may have a bigger scope than I usually want. 

## Install
Right now this is only for Windows and expects you to have Python, Pip, and Venv. 
(on the path too)

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/JiveyGuy/minimal_py_template.git
ren minimal_py_template my_project_name
cd my_project_name
install.bat
activate.bat
run.bat
```

That's all it takes to use!
